# Contributing

Keep `README.md` user-facing. Put contributor workflow here.

## Requirements

- Bun 1.2+
- Node 20+
- OpenCode CLI (`opencode`)
- Python 3.11+

## Local setup

```bash
bun install
npm install -g opencode-ai
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
```

## Run from source

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["file:///absolute/path/to/opensearch/src/index.ts"]
}
```

## Validate

```bash
bun run check
mkdocs build --strict

`bun run check` runs typecheck, tests, and build.

## Release

- releases run through `semantic-release` on `main`
- npm publish runs through GitHub Actions trusted publishing via OIDC
- the docs site publishes from GitHub Pages
